# This website was created to as a monster management system, in this application you can create, edit, view, and delete all monsters in this application. The target audience is for anyon running a DND campaign and need somewhere to manage their monster

### Currently there is a page to view all the data as a table, a second page to view all monsters in a card format, a third page to add monster with a controlled form, a fourth page to display when a monster is delete, and any updates to the monsters are done in the card format with the "update" button and they saved with the "save" button. In the future I will attempt to deploy on hiroku and add style changes. The Front-end was created using ReactJs and the back-end was created using Java17, MySQL, and Spring Tool Suit.
